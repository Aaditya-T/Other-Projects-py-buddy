# Project-1(pilot navigation system)
# you are a pilot, you are in the air, you are approching an airport where you need to land a plane.
# So there is a need of navigation system which can help hte pilot should I land the plane or make a go around.
# cases with the pilot are -
# i .If your altitude height is more than 10,000 feet, just go around then land
# ii .If your altitude is 5,000 feet, drop the landing gears.
# iii .If your altitude is less than 3,000 try landing the plane with brakes.

# We need conditional statement
# It is going to have 3 conditions.
# Things used for this program
# 1- IF , ELIF , ELSE
# 2- INPUT()


altitude = int(input("Hello pilot, please insert your current altitude - "))

if altitude >= 10000:
  print("Go around and land the plane after reducing your altitude  to 5000")
elif altitude >= 5000 and altitude <= 9999:
  print("Drop landing gears")
elif altitude >= 3000:
  print("Reduce height a bit more")
else:
  print("land the plane")
